Bravura and Academico together don't have:
    triangle symbol 0x25B3

Bounding box seems a bit small:

    I think I need to adjust verticals for string (not just width)

    I want to do "await main()" at toplevel, but I don't get exceptions that way.
    In 0.5.1 I do "main().catch((err)=>...)" then do a loop in rust side.
    Same thing works in 0.6.0!
    What is the best way to do this in rust side? Should be something like std_await
